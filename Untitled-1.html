  <p tts-paragraph-index="3"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>If you’re brand new to skateboarding (and we’ll assume so if you’ve found this guide), the first thing you’re gonna want to know is the differences between the many types of boards out there! </p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="4"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Unlike other, overly complex and overwhelming, guides we came across, we wanted to make this as simple as possible for you to encourage your skateboarding journey and help you to make your first skateboard purchase.</p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="5"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Simplicity is the key, BUT if you’re still confused after reading the guide, <a target="_blank" href="mailto:%20ajay24092002@gmail.com" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>hit us up on email </span></a>with any questions.</p>
  <h2><strong><span tts-paragraph-index="6"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Different types of skateboards:</span></strong></h2>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="7"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Although there are many different types of skateboard it pretty much comes down to two (well, 3) categories. These categories will help you decide on riding style before getting into the nitty gritty of the sub-categories and specialist boards. It ultimately comes down to: Longboards, Shortboards and Electric Skateboards. Read on to find the best skateboard for you.</p>

  <h2><span tts-paragraph-index="8"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>1. Types of Longboard</span></h2>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="9"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>If you are looking to cruise, carve or bomb big hills, you’ll want a longboard of some sort. Longboards can be broken down into the following categories:</p>
  <h3><span tts-paragraph-index="10"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Cruiser Boards </span></h3>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="11"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Cruiser boards are what comes to mind when you say ’longboard’. They are designed to get you from point A to point B, while offering a flow-y, carve-y ride that more mimics riding a snowboard. Beginners would want to start here to get the feel of riding a longboard. </p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="12"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>These can come either ‘Top Mounted’ or ‘Drop Through’, referring to the way the trucks are mounted to the deck.</p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="13"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Cruiser longboards can come in many shapes. Most popular are Pintails like the <a target="_blank" href="https://fireballsupply.co/products/sector-9-shoreline-ledger-longboard-complete?_pos=1&amp;_psq=sector&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Sector 9 Shoreline Ledger</span></a>, Twin Tips and Double Drops.</p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="14"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>If a cruiser longboard sounds like what you’re after, explore all the different shapes and things to consider in the <a target="_blank" href="https://stokedrideshop.com/blogs/ultimate-guides/the-ultimate-longboard-deck-guide" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>ultimate longboard deck guide</span></a>.</p>
  <h3><span tts-paragraph-index="15"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Freestyle / Dancers</span></h3>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="16"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>These are for those who want to do flip tricks and/or dance on their longboard. These are double kick skateboards that are a little smaller, lighter and sit lower to the ground than the cruiser longboards mentioned above to allow for improved maneuverability.</p>
  <h3><span tts-paragraph-index="17"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Freeride / Downhill Longboard</span></h3>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="18"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>These boards are designed for high speeds and are usually heavier and stiffer to avoid speed wobbles. We would not recommend beginners try freeride or downhill longboarding to begin and therefore won’t get into further details of shapes etc. </p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="19"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>If you do want to know more, check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://stokedrideshop.com/blogs/ultimate-guides/the-ultimate-longboard-deck-guide" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>ultimate longboard deck guide</span></a>.</p>
  <h3><span tts-paragraph-index="20"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>LDP (Long Distance Pumping)</span></h3>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="21"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Boards built specifically for long distance pumping and slalom. Similarly to Surf Skates (below) the aim of the game with these is to pump, not push. </p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="22"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>There are also some long distance push skateboards. These are typically drop through and dropped deck to allow for the easiest push, minimizing effort per push. They are also frequently made from exotic materials, like carbon fiber / fiberglass.</p>
  <p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2322/6483/files/skateboard_decks.jpg?v=1663787581" alt="skateboarding decks "></p>
  <h2><span tts-paragraph-index="23"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>2. Types of Shortboard</span></h2>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="24"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>If you’re looking to hit the skatepark, vert ramp, street skate or want something to stash in your locker at school, you’ll want a shortboard! Shortboards are made up of the following sub-categories:</p>
  <h3><span tts-paragraph-index="25"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Street Skateboards (Aka Double Kick or Popsicle)</span></h3>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="26"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>These are what you may refer to as a traditional skateboard, standard skateboard or popsicle skateboard. Whatever you wish to call it, the boards feature an angled kicktail on one end, and angled nose on the other, for popping up curbs &amp; flip tricks. Typically, they run around 32” in length and come in different sizes of widths so you can choose your preference based on your skateboarding style:</p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="27"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span><strong><span>Wider boards </span></strong>(8.75” - 9.5”) are typically used for ramps and pool skating as it gives greater stability. </p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="28"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span><strong><span>Narrower boards </span></strong>(7.75” - 8.5”) are typically used for performing tricks. Of course, these are not hard and fast rules and you’d want to try a few sizes at your local shop before picking up your first one. </p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="29"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>If you are starting from scratch, you will want a fully built out complete skateboard (vs choosing your skateboard deck and components). This would usually come with smaller hard wheels and traditional kingpin (TKP) trucks.</p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="30"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>These boards usually will come in hard smaller wheel sizes, ranging from 50mm to 60mm.</p>
  <h3><span tts-paragraph-index="31"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Mini Cruiser Skateboards</span></h3>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="32"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>These are usually around 28 - 32” in length and are designed for getting from point A to B, while still offering some ability to perform tricks. They typically have soft wheels to allow you to cruise over small rocks and debris and sit a little higher off the ground than your standard skateboard to allow for better maneuverability. </p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="33"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>In terms of widths popular mini cruisers run 8.5” to 9”, giving you a little more width and therefore stability when cruising. Mini cruisers are great for commuting due to their size and portability Unlike regular size cruisers, you can throw it in your trunk or stash in your college locker with ease. </p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="34"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Most Mini Cruisers also come with a directional kicktail (but no nose) to allow you to ollie and perform a lot of the tricks you’d be able to on a regular skateboard while cruising around town. </p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="35"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>There are also even smaller boards like Penny Boards which are sometimes classified as ‘micro cruisers’. Personally we would advise you steer clear of these as they are too small to really skate for more than 5 minutes and offer far less in terms of diversity than most regular mini cruisers. They are also mostly plastic, which does not ride as well or tend to last as long as maple. </p>
  <h3><span tts-paragraph-index="36"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Old School Skateboards </span></h3>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="37"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Old school boards are becoming more and more popular, with a lot of this credit going to the Powell-Peralta Re-Issue series featuring replica decks that the likes of Tony Hawk, Rodney Mullen and the whole Bones Brigade team rode back in the 80s. </p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="38"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>The boards are wider (9 - 10”) and mostly flatter than their modern counterparts, often just having a single kicktail and no angled nose. That said, you can still perform many freestyle tricks.</p>
  
  <h3><span tts-paragraph-index="39"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Surf Skates </span></h3>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="40"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Smaller boards that have specialized truck systems to allow you to carve much tighter than you’d otherwise be able to, replicating that shortboard surfing feeling on land. The decks are wider than usual to provide more stability and seem to be shaped more like a surfboard, although realistically this does not provide any benefit to the rider. You can actually convert any skateboard into a surfskate with the <a target="_blank" href="https://fireballsupply.co/products/waterborne-surf-and-rail-adapter-pack" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Waterborne Surf Adapter.</span></a></p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="41"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>There aren’t really too many different styles available when it comes to surfskates. Unlike Surfboards which come in a bunch of shapes, skateboard surfskates are all around the size of a popsicle deck at around 31/32inch in length. Longboard surfers would probably want to stick to a larger longboard skateboard. </p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="42"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Surf Skaters will want a sharp lipped, softer wheel to provide maximum grip when carving.</p>
  <h2><span tts-paragraph-index="43"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>3. Electric Skateboards</span></h2>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="44"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>If you’re looking to go 30MPH while exerting as little effort as possible, an E-skateboard is for you. </p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="45"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Electric skateboards can come in both longboard and shortboard styles and are mostly controlled by a handheld remote control that allows you to speed up and slow down. If you are looking for a e-skateboard we would most definitely recommend getting used to it in a secure area (such as an empty parking lot) as we find the controls take some getting used to. Expect a few close calls while getting the hang of it. </p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="46"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Functionally, electric skateboards work in the exact same way as regular longboard skateboards but the back truck features a belt drive that propels the board forward and backwards. Carving and cruising are still very much possible, but you’ll struggle to perform any real tricks on these boards. </p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="47"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Aside from the electric motor, the other main thing you’d notice with an e-board is larger wheels, usually running from 80 - 100mm. Obviously (with all else equal) the larger the wheel the faster you’ll go but the slower you’ll accelerate. This gives you somewhat of an option to choose a faster acceleration or faster top speed, in a similar way to, say, switching out the sprocket on your bicycle or motorcycle.</p>
  <h2><span tts-paragraph-index="48"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Skateboard Anatomy &amp; Components </span></h2>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="49"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Now that you’ve got an overview of the main skateboard types, we will touch upon the anatomy and components that ALL types of skateboard will consist of. </p>
  <p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2322/6483/files/Skateboard_components.png?v=1662164162" alt="skateboard components "></p>
  <h3><span tts-paragraph-index="50"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Skateboard Deck</span></h3>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="51"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>The deck is 1 of 5 main components that differentiates between the type of board. A skateboard deck is the wooden part of the board that you stand on and comes in a variety of shapes as you will have learned above. If you are unsure as to what size your would need, we recommend hitting up your local skate shop to physically stand on the boards and get some in-person advice.</p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="52"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>The other thing that we didn’t mention above is the wheelbase. Skaters usually measure the wheelbase of the deck from the lower inner bolt hole to the upper inner bolt hole, thus dictating how far apart the trucks sit. </p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="53"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Why is this important? It allows you to know how sharp you’ll be able to turn - the smaller the wheelbase, the sharper the turn, and vice versa.</p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="54"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>NOW. This is only a base idea as different trucks put the wheels in different positions.

  <h3><span tts-paragraph-index="55"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Skateboard Trucks</span></h3>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="56"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>The goal of the trucks is to attach the deck to the wheels.</p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="57"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Skateboard trucks come in two types: Reverse Kingpin (RKP) or Traditional Kingpin (TKP). </p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="58"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Reverse kingpin trucks work in... you guessed it.. reverse to standard TKP trucks to allow for tighter turning. They are usually found on longboard set up for cruising and carving. Traditional kingpin trucks are what you would find on any regular skateboard setup and are best for grinding.</p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="59"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Each skateboard truck features a set of urethane bushings that dictate the amount of turn / lean that you can achieve. If you find your board does not turn enough after loosening your trucks at the ‘axle nut’, we would recommend upgrading your bushings.</p>
  <p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2322/6483/files/skateboard_trucks.jpg?v=1663787500" alt="skateboard trucks "></p>
  <h3><span tts-paragraph-index="60"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Skateboard Wheels </span></h3>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="61"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>The last components of differentiation between shortboards and longboards is the wheels. Wheels are made from polyurethane and come in a variety of sizes and durometer (hardness).</p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="62"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Harder, small wheels are more aimed at street or standard skateboarding. They range from 50mm to 60mm in diameter and from 90a to 100a on the A Scale of Durometer.</p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="63"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Softer larger wheels are pretty much better for everything else. They range from 60mm on the low end, to 80mm+ on the high end for some longboards. Durometer-wise they range from around 75a to 90a.</p>
  <h3><span tts-paragraph-index="64"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Skateboard Bearings</span></h3>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="65"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>These are fitted inside the wheel and allow the wheel to smoothly rotate on the axle of the truck.</p>
  <p tts-paragraph-index="66"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>Bearings work universally for both longboards and skateboards. Head over to our <a target="_blank" href="https://fireballsupply.co/collections/bearings" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>skateboard bearings</span></a> page to learn more about bearings. If you don’t want to do that, here are a few tips to get you started:</p>
  <ul>
  <li tts-paragraph-index="67"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>The ABEC system is not related to skateboarding. Don’t be fooled by marketing tactics of, honestly, way too many bearing brands! ABEC 3/5/7/9 are no-go’s.</li>
  <li tts-paragraph-index="68"><span class="tts-paragraph-player"><span class="tts-circle"></span><span class="tts-paragraph-player-button tts-play-icon" title="Play/Pause"></span></span>The bearings are probably going to make the biggest difference to your board (along with wheels). If you’re buying a cheaper board to see if you like skateboarding, this would be the first thing we’d switch out.</li>
